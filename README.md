# Guess-the-Number-Game
Create a number game guessing program that
allows the user to guess a randomly generated
number. The user starts with 100 points. For
each guess, 1 point is deducted, and the
program tells the user if the guess is too high,
too low or bingo. Display the final score
when the guess is correct.
